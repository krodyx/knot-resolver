Knot Resolver 1.2.2 (2017-02-10)
================================

Bugfixes:
---------
- Fix -k argument processing to avoid out-of-bounds memory accesses
- lib/resolve: fix zonecut fetching for explicit DS queries
- hints: more NULL checks
- Fix TA bootstrapping for multiple TAs in the IANA XML file

Testing:
--------
- Update tests to run tests with and without QNAME minimization

Knot Resolver 1.2.1 (2017-02-01)
====================================

Security:
---------
- Under certain conditions, a cached negative answer from a CD query
  would be reused to construct response for non-CD queries, resulting
  in Insecure status instead of Bogus.  Only 1.2.0 release was affected.

Documentation
-------------
- Update the typo in the documentation: The query trace policy is
  named policy.QTRACE (and not policy.TRACE)

Bugfixes:
---------
- lua: make the map command check its arguments

Knot Resolver 1.2.0 (2017-01-24)
====================================

Security:
---------
- In a policy.FORWARD() mode, the AD flag was being always set by mistake.
  It is now cleared, as the policy.FORWARD() doesn't do DNSSEC validation yet.

Improvements:
-------------
- The DNSSEC Validation has been refactored, fixing many resolving
  failures.
- Add module `version` that checks for updates and CVEs periodically.
- Support RFC7830: EDNS(0) padding in responses over TLS.
- Support CD flag on incoming requests.
- hints module: previously /etc/hosts was loaded by default, but not anymore.
  Users can now actually avoid loading any file.
- DNS over TLS now creates ephemeral certs.
- Configurable cache.{min,max}_tll option, with max_ttl defaulting to 6 days.
- Option to reorder RRs in the response.
- New policy.QTRACE policy to print packet contents

Bugfixes:
---------
- Trust Anchor configuration is now more robust.
- Correctly answer NOTIMPL for meta-types and non-IN RR classes.
- Free TCP buffer on cancelled connection.
- Fix crash in hints module on empty hints file, and fix non-lowercase hints.

Miscelaneous:
-------------
- It now requires knot >= 2.3.1 to link successfully.
- The API+ABI for modules changed slightly.
- New LRU implementation.


Knot Resolver 1.1.1 (2016-08-24)
================================

Bugfixes:
---------
 - Fix 0x20 randomization with retransmit
 - Fix pass-through for the stub mode
 - Fix the root hints IPv6 addresses
 - Fix dst addr for retries over TCP

Improvements:
-------------
 - Track RTT of all tried servers for faster retransmit
 - DAF: Allow forwarding to custom port
 - systemd: Read EnvironmentFile and user $KRESD_ARGS
 - systemd: Update systemd units to be named after daemon


Knot Resolver 1.1.0 (2016-08-12)
================================

Improvements:
-------------
 - RFC7873 DNS Cookies
 - RFC7858 DNS over TLS
 - HTTP/2 web interface, RESTful API
 - Metrics exported in Prometheus
 - DNS firewall module
 - Explicit CNAME target fetching in strict mode
 - Query minimisation improvements
 - Improved integration with systemd
